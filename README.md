Hi! Thank you for taking your time to read my codes written in Trip!
<br> <br>
Due to the contract I have signed with Trip(携程), I can't share the codes I've written in the company! <br><br>

However, some statistics and information can be outlined as follows:
<br><br>
1. I have written over thousands(beyond 2k) lines of codes. <br>
2. Most of the codes consist of Sql, Hive, Spark(80%); The rest consist of shell and python.<br>
3. My daily routine during the intern includes: constructing data tables that contain data needed to help model the algorithms; Meeting with Production Group to help them finalize their decisions or brainstorm some ideas; Writing python codes to build up models to solve problems. <br>
4. Projects I have participated include the following:<br>
      1): helped to improve the accuracy for predicting prices of airline tickets in the 7/30/60days. And I constructed/maintained the 7,30 sametake database tables, wrote python codes for 30 days/half year/one year ROI evaluation.<br>
      2): Responsible for risk management project(confidential), I have trained a machine learning model and improve its precision to 90% compared with its last update version for five years ago.<br>
      3): Price lock project(confidential) <br>
